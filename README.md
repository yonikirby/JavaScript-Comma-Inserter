"# Yonatan-Kirby-s-Projects" 

Hello.

I have experience programming in Java in several classes, including Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking and Software Engineering.

I also have experience in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP and many other things. My personal website is http://yonatankirby.atwebpages.com/

My Java Wikipedia Question-Asker is in this folder. Instructions for how to set up the program are on my personal website.

My social networking website is online at http://www.socialnetwork.a2hosted.com/ and you can test its features there. The files are stored in the appropriate folder, and are written in PHP.

My comma-inserter is also available online at http://grammareditor.atwebpages.com/ and its file is stored in this folder.

Thank you very much for viewing.

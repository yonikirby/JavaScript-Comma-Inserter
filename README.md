"# Yonatan-Kirby-s-Projects" 

Hello.

I have experience programming in Java in several classes, including Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking and Software Engineering.

I also have experience in Node.JS, React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP and many other things. My personal website is http://www.socialnetwork.a2hosted.com/yonatankirby

My Java Wikipedia Question-Asker is here on Github. Instructions for how to set up the program are in the readme file.

My social networking website is online at http://www.socialnetwork.a2hosted.com/ and you can test its features there. The files are also on Github here.

My comma-inserter is also available online at http://www.socialnetwork.a2hosted.com/grammareditor and it is also stored here on Github.

Thank you very much for viewing.
